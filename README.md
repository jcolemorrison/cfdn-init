Scaffolded by [CloudFoundation](https://github.com/jcolemorrison/cloudfoundation) - The CLI tool for creating, managing, and deploying large CloudFormation templates and projects.

This project is the result of the [`cfdn init`](https://github.com/jcolemorrison/cloudfoundation#cfdn-init) and [`cfdn create`](https://github.com/jcolemorrison/cloudfoundation#cfdn-create-template-name) commands.

In `src` you'll find three template directories:

- `db` - RDS Aurora template
- `vpc` - VPC template
- `main` - base template from `cfdn init`
